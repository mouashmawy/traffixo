- A very small project for Linear Course

</br>
<h3> Brief </h3>
The software is a traffic recommendation system that takes the number of cars entering and getting out of a certain node to get the number of cars in every street and thus recommend the driver for the least traffic street. The real project will detect the cars using wither radar or google maps and then recommend the driver which street to take
